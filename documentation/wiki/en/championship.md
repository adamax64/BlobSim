# Overview

The Blob Championship System is a complex system of competition between blobs. The championship is divided into several levels called leagues and several time slots called seasons.

# Championship events

The basic unit of the championship is a championship event. These are the indivual competitions where blobs compare their skills in various ways to get out on top.

There are several kinds of events where blobs compete with each other. Each event type require a different set of skills.

## Quartered high jump

This is the oldest event type of all. The competition is divided into four quarters. Each quarter blobs who are still in the game have one or two tries (depending on event type) to jump as high as they can, which requires both speed and strength.

At the end of the quarter blobs at the bottom of the order are eliminated and cannot compete in the next quarters, meaning they final position for that competition is set. The number of eliminations in each quarter depends on the number of blobs. The main rule is that the same amount of blobs should be eliminated in each quarter and the number of blobs competing in the final quarter should be the same as the number of eliminated blobs, but at least three. If the number of blobs are not dividable by four, the final quarter should have the most blobs, but not more than six.

## Endurance race

In this competition blobs are racing with each other on a racetrack for a set amount of time. Blobs in races need to rely entirely on their speed to finish ahead of the others.

The timespan of the race is determined by the number of blobs competing in the event. Assuming that the smaller the field is, the younger, thus slower the competitors are, the timespans are determined by the following table:

| Field size | Timespan of the race |
|---|---|
| 5 - 7 | 60 ticks |
| 8 - 10 | 75 ticks |
| 11 - 13 | 90 ticks |
| 14 - 17 | 100 ticks |
| 18 - 21 | 110 ticks |
| 22+ | 120 ticks |

The final order is determined by the most distance driven after the specified amount of time.

## Elimination scoring

Blobs in this event needs to show their pure strength to compete with each other. In each round blobs are set in front of a machine where they need to hit the target sensor as hard as they can to set their score for that round. In each rount the blob with the least score is eliminated. Scores are not brought to the next round every time the contenders are ranked by their current performance.

The elimination rounds goes on until all blobs are eliminated except the winner.

# Point system

Blobs are rewarded with points after the position they got along with bonus points they can get during the competitions.

## Base points

The position based points are calculated the following way: last place gets one point, and the other places get as much more as the difference their position to last place (so last place gets 1, then second to last gets 2, then the next one 3, than 4 etc.).

Podium places are exception if the field size is larger than or equal to 6. In this case the next higher position gets two more points than the previous one (so if 3rd place gets 10 points then 2nd gets 12 and 1st gets 14).

## Bonus points

In endurance races and elimination scoring only the winner gets one bonus point, so it's like the winner gets three more points than second place. In quartered high jumps hovewer, one bonus point is granted after each quarter for those who win that quarter. This means that someone who does not win the final quarter, but won in previous quarters can get the equal amount or even more points overall than the blob finished one position above.
